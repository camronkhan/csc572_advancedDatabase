Reliable Consulting Firm

The Computer Systems (CS) department of the Reliable Consulting Firm is responsible for completing projects
(designing database systems) for external customers. The CS manager has decided that there is a need for
the CS department staff to create and maintain a database system of their own to keep track of the CS
employees and each of the projects they have been assigned to.

1. For each CS employee, list the employee number, employee name (first and last), office location
number, the job title (position), and the number and name of the CS group in which the employee
works.

2. For each CS employee list the employee name (first and last) and for each project to which the
employee is assigned, list the project number and name (description), the percent of the employee’s
time assigned to the project, and the total number of hours the employee has worked on the project so
far.

3. For each CS project, list the project number and name (description), the name of the customer
(business) that requested the project, the name of the contact person at that business, the project type
(maintenance, database, support, or reports), project status (planning, in progress, on hold, completed),
start date, end date, total budgeted person-hours, total budgeted dollars, and the name of the CS
employee serving as project leader.

4. For each CS group, list the group number and the group name. For each employee in the group, list
the employee’s number, name, position, work phone number, and for each project, to which that
employee is assigned, list the project number, percent of that employee’s time assigned to the project.

Notes:
 Treat each of the 4 requirements as an individual user view and apply the database design
methodology.
 As you read through each requirement make note of the relationships and any special restrictions. You
can determine the relationships (one-to-many or many-to-many) between the entities based upon the
wording in each of the user views. Hint: There is a many-to-many relationship in the design.
 The points are assigned as follow as (maximum of 10 points):
o 1 point for the 3NF DBDL and special restrictions (if any) for each user requirement
o 4 points for the cumulative design DBDL
o 2 points for the data structure diagram
